### Hi there 👋

🐁 My name is **Matthew Francis**, also known as **themousery**. I have used computers my entire life and have always been fascinated by their inner workings. After discovering coding at the age of 12, I passionately read and practiced, learning multiple programming languages, along with a great deal of periphery skills. I am always learning, building, and looking for opportunities to grow.

💌 My email is [matthew@themousery.com](mailto:matthew@themousery.com).

🧑‍💻 I have been providing freelance services since 2019. I help businesses create software automation flows, from web scrapers to spreadsheet tools.

🖨️ In 2021 I started studying and working in Web3. I built a Web3 merch store from the ground up: [PrintCoin](https://printcoin.art/).
